# Data-Visualization-Capstone-Project-PROJ-052-003

This Capstone Project for the Data Science course PROJ-052-003 aims to consolidate all the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course. The project involves presenting a dataset from initial cleaning and pre-processing using Python to the final visualization using PowerBI.  This project highlights the critical role of data visualization in understanding and communicating complex data trends, patterns, and relationships. The dashboard is designed to be insightful and accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences, serving as a reference, framework, and tool for further refinement.

This repository includes three essential files:
  
1. PowerBI File [link]: The main visualization file showcasing the insights derived from the dataset.
  
2. Design Document [link]: A comprehensive guide detailing the design and development process of the project.
  
3. User Orientation Document [link]: Instructions and guidelines for users to navigate and interpret the dashboard effectively.
